# Description
Rectifica is fully feature integrated application that could help the education system improve by making use of technology to automate every process. This projects is built on custum made word embedding models that has the capability to give good accuracy.  

# Features
1. Grading subjective answers using deep learning algorithms.
2. Schedule meeting for teachers and students.

# Tech Stack
1. Django
2. javascript
3. Postgres

# What we built it
We created a authenticated web application that lets you write subjective answers for given question and grades them. It lets teacher to schedule meet for students and interact with them. Teachers can add questions whenever they want to test knowledge of their students.

# How we built it
We divided our project into sub modules to make it simpler. And then distributed submodules among team.

# Challanges we ran into
Integrating video conferencing application with subjective answer grader was challenging part for us.

# What we learnt
We learnt to integrate deep learning model with web applications. 

# What's next for ANY-A
1. Facial Attendance System
2. Deep learning Model that summarizes virtual meets
3. Grading Mathematical Solutions
